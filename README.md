# numerus

This Python library is not intended for wider use, though feel free to use it if
you so wish. It is a Mathematical utility library, but numPy, pandas, etc. will
be much more useful, reliable and efficient than this.

This library exists because the best way to understand a concept in Mathematics,
and I mean *really* understand, is to code an implementation of it yourself.
Much more just reading about a topic, even more than re-writing the concept in
your own words, having to define what is a class and what its relationship to
other concepts is really cements in your mind how they actually work.

The real use of this library then, is not its use, but in the writing of it
itself.

As such it will not have formal documentation, and there will only be
integration tests, not unit tests (probably).

## Topics covered

Linear Algebra (`linalg.py`)

Statistics (`stats.py`)

Calculus (`calculus.py`)
