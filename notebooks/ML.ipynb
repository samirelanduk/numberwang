    "Machine learning is the ability of computers to take a dataset of objects and learn patterns about them. This dataset is structured as a table, where each row is a vector representing some object by encoding their properties as the values of the vector. The columns represent **features** - properties that all the objects share.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, broadly speaking, two kinds of machine learning. **Supervised learning** has an extra column at the end of the dataset, and the program learns to predict the value of this based on the input features for some new object. If the output value is continuous, it is **regression**, otherwise it is **classification**. **Unsupervised learning** seeks to find patterns within the data by, for example, clustering.\n",
